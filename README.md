This full-stack web application allows users to search, save, and manage recipes in a clean and user-friendly interface. Built primarily with PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, it features:

- User Authentication: Secure login and registration system.

- Recipe Search: Filter recipes by keywords and ingredients.

- Favorites: Save your favorite recipes to a personal list.

- Responsive UI: Clean design with HTML/CSS for a smooth browsing experience across devices.

Our focus on this project was on database integration, session management, and building a seamless user journey from search to save functionality.
